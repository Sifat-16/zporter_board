## Object Model Design

### Key Entities

The following entities have been designed to represent the core features of the app, such as match details, teams, players, and tactical diagrams.

### 1. **User**

The `User` object stores information about the users of the app (coaches, referees, and team managers). It is essential for managing access and actions in the system.

#### Attributes
- `uid`: Unique identifier for the user.
- `email`: User's email address.
- `displayName`: User's display name.
- `photoURL`: Profile photo URL.

#### Pseudocode

}
